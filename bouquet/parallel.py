"""Process-parallel bouquets: the draws of one bouquet (:func:`parallel_generate`) or many bouquets on
one node (:func:`parallel_cases`).

``OFT_env`` is a per-process singleton, so a second TokaMaker cannot live in the
same interpreter -- parallelism is across **processes**, each with its own
solver. Draws are embarrassingly parallel, and the baseline forward-solve is
**bit-identical across processes at ``nthreads=1``** (verified: a fresh process
reproduces li_1/li_3/Ip/psi to 0), so every worker simply runs the ordinary
serial path (``setup_solver -> prepare_baseline -> generate``) on its shard of
``n_equils`` and the per-worker archives are concatenated.

Two launchers, one ``run_shard`` entry point:

* **laptop / single node** -- :func:`parallel_generate` drives a
  ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` (spawn), one single-threaded worker per core
  (:mod:`bouquet.threads`).
* **cluster** -- :func:`emit_slurm_script` writes a SLURM job-array + dependent
  merge job that call ``python -m bouquet.parallel`` on the same ``run_shard``.

Note: parallel draws are NOT bit-identical to a serial run of the same seed --
each worker's ``GenerationConfig.seed`` (and hence the single
``numpy.random.Generator`` its ``generate_bouquet`` builds via
``sampling.make_rng``) is derived from ``(seed, worker_id, scan_key)`` via
``np.random.SeedSequence`` (see :func:`_derive_seed`), so the union is a
statistically-equivalent *different* draw set. The baseline is identical.
Folding the ``scan_key`` into the derivation decorrelates a multi-slice sweep
run with one ``seed``: draw *i* of slice A and draw *i* of slice B no longer
share a perturbation stream.

The parallel run IS reproducible as a whole: the derivation is a pure function
of ``(seed, worker_id, scan_key)``, so re-running the same ``seed`` over the
same ``n_workers`` regenerates every shard's draws bitwise. Changing
``n_workers`` re-partitions the draws and therefore changes the ensemble --
record it alongside the seed.

**Shared until-N.**  ``generation.n_inspec_target`` is honoured on both
launchers through a *shared yield ledger*: every worker records each draw that
passes the in-loop filters, and checks the pooled count at the top of every
attempt, stopping once the run's ONE target is met -- a cooperative stop at the
attempt boundary, never a kill, so every archived draw is complete.  The
laptop pool shares a ``multiprocessing.Manager`` counter; the SLURM array
shares an append-only file on the job's filesystem.  Up to one extra in-spec
draw per worker can land after the threshold (a draw in flight is finished,
not discarded), so the merged archive holds *at least* the target.  The
attempt cap ``max_total_draws`` is split across workers the same way
``n_equils`` is, so a zero-yield configuration still terminates.

A shared-stop run is reproducible in a different sense from a fixed-``n``
one: each draw is still a pure function of ``(seed, worker_id, scan_key,
index)``, but WHICH draws exist depends on worker timing.  The merged archive
therefore carries a manifest (scan-group attr ``parallel_manifest_json``) with
every worker's attempt count; replaying those counts as fixed per-worker
allocations regenerates the archive exactly.

    Draw groups are renumbered to a contiguous running index; under schema v2

    rename is needed (the group path carries the coordinates). The
    ``_baseline`` group is copied once (the baseline is identical across
    workers). Returns ``(out_path, n_draws)``.

    Pass the RUN-level ``config`` (the original :class:`~bouquet.BouquetConfig`,
    not a per-worker mutation) to stamp ``config_json`` provenance onto the
    merged archive -- the shards' own provenance records per-worker configs
    (derived seed, shard n_equils, ``_w{i}`` header) and is not copied, and
    the shards themselves are deleted under ``cleanup=True``, so without this
    the deliverable file carries no config record.

    Every shard's stored baseline (``_baseline`` attrs ``l_i_target`` /
    ``Ip_target``) is verified against the first shard's before anything is
    copied; a drift beyond ``baseline_match_rtol`` raises. This is the merge's
    own guard -- unlike the pre-merge check in :func:`parallel_generate` it
    also covers the SLURM CLI path, where drifted baselines (heterogeneous
    nodes, a stray ``nthreads>1``) would otherwise merge silently, mixing
    draws accepted against different l_i targets. Shards whose baselines differ
    in ``profile_coord`` (ψ_N vs Φ_N grids) also raise. A listed shard that does not
    exist on disk raises (missing workers must be handled by the caller, not
    dropped silently).

    ``missing_workers`` (a list of worker ids the caller knowingly left out,
    e.g. the CLI's ``--allow-missing``) marks the result as a PARTIAL merge:
    the manifest and the scan group carry ``merge_partial_json`` and
    ``n_requested_source`` says so, since the run-level request was not
    delivered by the shards merged. Shards whose worker records disagree on
    the generation mode or the shared target, or that counted against
    different boundary cuts, are refused before anything is written.

    Serialises the run into ``{job_name}_bundle.json`` (config via
    ``BouquetConfig.to_dict``) and writes two sbatch
    scripts plus a ``{job_name}_submit.sh`` that chains them with
    ``--dependency=afterany`` (the merge validates shards itself: it aborts
    loudly on missing workers or a drifted baseline, so it is safe -- and
    more informative -- to let it run after a partial array instead of
    leaving it pending forever behind ``afterok``). Nothing is launched.
    Returns the written paths.

    ``setup`` is an optional list of shell lines inserted before the payload
    in BOTH sbatch scripts -- environment activation the compute node needs,
    e.g. ``["module load conda", "conda activate bouquet",
    "export OFT_PYTHONPATH=/path/to/OFT/python"]``. Without OFT importable,
    every shard dies at ``import OpenFUSIONToolkit``.

    Launch with ``{job_name}_submit.sh`` -- it ``cd``'s to its own directory
    first, so it works from any CWD. (The sbatch scripts reference the bundle
    by basename and therefore assume the submission CWD is ``out_dir``;
    shard/merged ``.h5`` outputs land there too unless

    chunksize : int or "automatic"

    use_logical_cpus : bool

        The worker count, bypassing detection.
    verbose : bool
        Stream worker output to the terminal instead of ``worker_N.log``.
    merge, group_by, cleanup
        :func:`merge_cases` on the successful cases.
    before_baseline, after_baseline : callable, optional
        ``f(bouquet, case)`` either side of ``prepare_baseline()`` on the worker: per-case setup a
        ``CaseSpec`` cannot express (solver targets before; anything on the baseline's grid after, e.g.
