"""The subprocess probes must import the tree under test, not an installed one.

This guards the harness itself.  The bug it pins was silent and cost two
investigations (see ``tests/_harness.py``): a probe launched as a script gets
``sys.path[0] = <repo>/tests``, finds no ``bouquet`` there, and falls through to
an editable install that may point at an entirely different checkout.  The
probe then solves against the wrong revision while the parent's assertions
describe code that was never exercised.

These tests are cheap and solve-free: they check the wiring, not the physics.
